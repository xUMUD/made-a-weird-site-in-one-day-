    <article>
        <p class="section">as you might have read in the title, this is mainly about NVIDIA's competitors, actually... there's just one concurrent company racing with NVIDIA and that's AMD. As you might have read in the home page, AMD has been around for a very long time.
            NVIDIA's CEO being a worker at AMD, AMD gpu's have kind of been the underdogs for quite a bit since NVIDIA released their 900 series, the radeon series fell apart quickly right as the 900 series launched. They not only had to stop making those
            cards but also plan to make new flagship cards and so they came up with the rx 500 series as well as the 5000/6000XT series which quickly rose in popularity across the globe. which begs the question, how good is AMD and why was that comeback
            THAT big? I shall be explaining that on this part of my ted talk. </p>

                    <h2 class="cute-2">AMD is doing what NVIDIA WON'T... And it's awesome!</h2>
                    <p class="explanation">Anyways, now that we're off that quick summary. Let's talk about what's really important... and that's why AMD and NVIDIA are so tight on their race. That has to do with AMD's latest launch, radeon 6000 series. these cards are not
                        only less expensive but also just as good, if not better than the 3000 series. I'm not saying you should switch from NVIDIA to AMD, that's definitely not the case here. AMD comes with a few flaws and that's not having DLSS support
                        for example. DLSS gives you a huge FPS boost when you turn RTX mode on (which AMD doesn't have access to either). NVIDIA is definitely way better at third party managing and softening your experience out! Although AMD is thinking
                        off creating a better version of both DLSS and RTX, with 6000 cards on the line. They show amazing potential. Even if AMD isn't dominating the GPU side of things, they made a huge scene in the CPU branch. The ryzen series is so
                        big, NVIDIA couldn't even dare try to make CPU's, because of how good their CPU's are. Though I don't believe NVIDIA needs to go as far as making CPU's since they're already doing really well on the other side. though I feel conflicted
                        on how this race will end. as I mentioned earlier, AMD GPU prices are way lower than NVIDIA's. Even during the pandemic, AMD GPU's would be a better choice. Since they got better price/performance. </p>
